/* Vertex Attributes */
attribute vec4 mc_Entity; // This attribute holds fundamental information about the entity to which the vertex belongs. mc_Entity.x represents the item id. mc_Entity.y, mc_Entity.z, and mc_Entity.w are reserved. Currently it is only guaranteed to be valid for terrain.

/* composite Uniforms */
uniform mat4 gbufferProjection; // The 4x4 projection matrix that was used when the gbuffers were generated.
uniform mat4 gbufferProjectionInverse; // The inverse of gbufferProjection.
uniform mat4 gbufferPreviousProjection; // The 4x4 projection matrix that was used when the gbuffers were generated for the previous frame.
uniform mat4 gbufferPreviousModelView; // The 4x4 modelview matrix that was used after setting up the camera transformations when the gbuffers were generated for the previous frame.
uniform mat4 shadowProjection; // The 4x4 projection matrix that was used when the shadow map was generated.
uniform mat4 shadowProjectionInverse; // The inverse of shadowProjection.
uniform mat4 shadowModelView; // The 4x4 modelview matrix that was used when the shadow map was generated.
uniform mat4 shadowModelViewInverse; // The inverse of shadowModelView.
uniform sampler2D shadow; // The shadow map texture. Including this uniform declaration in a shader triggers the rendering of shadows to the shadow map.

/* Common Uniforms */
uniform int heldItemId; // An integer indicating the id of the currently held item or -1 if there is none.
uniform int heldBlockLightValue; // An integer indicating the light emission value of the held block. Typically ranges from 0 to 15.
uniform int fogMode; // An integer indicating the type of fog (usually linear or exponential) or 0 if there is no fog. Equivalent to glGetInteger(GL_FOG_MODE).
uniform int worldTime; // An integer indicating the current world time. For the over-world this number ranges from 0 to 24000 and loops.
uniform float viewWidth; // A float indicating the width of the viewport.
uniform float viewHeight; // A float indicating the height of the viewport.
uniform float aspectRatio; // A float derived from viewWidth / viewHeight.
uniform float near; // A float indicating the near viewing plane distance.
uniform float far; // A float indicating the far viewing plane distance.
uniform float rainStrength; // A float indicating the strength of the rain (or in cold biomes, snow).
uniform vec3 sunPosition; // A vec3 indicating the position of the sun in eye space.
uniform vec3 moonPosition; // A vec3 indicating the position of the moon in eye space.
uniform vec3 cameraPosition; // A vec3 indicating the position in world space of the entity to which the camera is attached.
uniform vec3 previousCameraPosition; // A vec3 indicating the position in world space of the entity to which the camera was attached during the previous frame.
uniform mat4 gbufferModelView; // The 4x4 modelview matrix after setting up the camera transformations. This uniform previously had a slightly different purpose in mind, so the name is a bit ambiguous.
uniform mat4 gbufferModelViewInverse; // The inverse of gbufferModelView.
